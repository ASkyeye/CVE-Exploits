# QBot panel Authentication Bypass

## Introduction

There is a BSS-based buffer overflow in the code that performs the authentication in the Qbot botnet panel allowing unauthenticated attackers to exploit both a BSS-overflow and a format strings vulnerability.

## Exploitation

As the BSS-overflow happens on the struct that contains the usernames and credentials in memory, opening multiple connections and overwriting the buffers makes it pretty easy to trigger the bug.

## Other

As it is not a centralized software, it has a lot of variants. I took three different examples and created an exploit for them.

Even with such amount of variants, none of them patched the bug.

I took the sources from GitHub repositories, the directory for each example is the user that posted it on GitHub.
