# CVE-2020-28018: Exim Use-after-free (UAF) leading to RCE
# --- NOT FINISHED ---

## Introduction

There exists a Use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability in `tls-openssl.c` that allow remote unauthenticated attackers to corrupt internal memory data, thus finally achieving remote code execution.

Known primitives:
- Memory Leakage
- Read-What-Where primitive
- Write-What-Where primitive

With the use of all those primitives chained together it is possible to fully bypass all the available exploit mitigations finally ending up on a remote code execution as the exim user.

This vulnerability has been released among a huge list of vulnerabilities, the official Qualys report chains the Use-After-Free with CVE-2020-28008 to perform a Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) once RCE has been achieved.

## Pre-requisites

The exim, should be configured / compiled in the following way:
- TLS is enabled
- OpenSSL is used (instead of GnuTLS)
- Exim is one of the vulnerable versions
- `X_PIPE_CONNECT` is disabled

## Vulnerable code

As we already know, the vulnerability is located at `tls-openssl.c`.

      return -1;

    case SSL_ERROR_NONE:

      buff += outbytes;
      break;

    case SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN:
      log_write(0, LOG_MAIN, "SSL channel closed on write");
      return -1;

    case SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL:
      log_write(0, LOG_MAIN, "SSL_write: (from %s) syscall: %s",

      return -1;

    default:

      return -1;
    }
  }
return len;
}
```

`smtp_setup_msg()` is the main function that performs the message reading from client.

On specific situations, `smtp_reset()` is called, which performs a clean up of all the buffers
and values.

This can happen in situations like:
- `HELO`/`EHLO` is received
- `STARTTLS` is received
- `RSET` is received
- At the starting of `smtp_setup_msg()`


At the end of `smtp_reset()`, a call to `store_reset()` is performed.

`store_reset` is a macro wrapping for `store_reset_3()` function.

The store functions are just functions that manage the dynamic memory.

Exim uses a pool allocator on blocks that are received from malloc.

There is also an interesting functionality which is a growable string
implementation.
 
`gstring` struct:
```c
typedef struct gstring {
  int   size;           /* Current capacity of string memory */
  int   ptr;            /* Offset at which to append further chars */
  uschar * s;           /* The string memory */
} gstring;
```

When needing more space for concatenating a new string, it calls `gstring_grow()`.

That function first tries to call `store_extend_3()`, that function tries to extend the memory
within the same pool block.

It can be useful when the length of the input is not known, but if more memory was allocated after
it we won't be able to extend it.

Then `gstring_grow()` calls `store_newblock_3()` which just returns a new memory and copies the 
bytes already present in the past one to the new one.

Then the `g->s`  pointer is restored from `gstring_catn()`.

In the function `tls_write()`, we can see there is a `BOOL` called `more`.

It indicates if there is more stuff to be copied into the string buffer before
returning the data back to the user.

If so, the pointer is not NULL'ed.

If not, then the data contained in the string buffer is returned to the user.

This functionality opens some interesting ways trigger a Use-After-Free.

First, the pointer to the `gstring` struct is stored at a static variable,
this means on future calls to `tls_write()` we will be able to use it.

How can we free the buffer and then be able to use it?

We need to make `smtp_setup_msg()` call `smtp_reset()` after one
of our buffers is still on `server_corked` (not NULL'ed).

After the reset, if we call `tls_write()` somehow, the pointer will
still be there, thus allowing us to use it after the memory has been freed.

`smtp_reset()` frees all the memory of `POOL_MAIN`, in which our buffer is contained.


## Triggering Use-After-Free

To control the Use-After-Free we need first to initialize a new connection.

As we want to exploit the `tls_write()` we need first to start a new TLS session.

So first we send a `EHLO` command, followed by a `STARTTLS` to start the TLS connection.

Then to make `more` be `1` we pipeline a command, and the final one will be the half of a `NOOP`.

We close the TLS connection and send the rest of the `NOOP` command.

We now send `EHLO` again, which will make `smtp_reset` be called and free our buffer.

Now we need to start another TLS connection to be able to use `tls_write()` again.

We send `STARTTLS`.

Now sending any command to the server will end up calling `tls_write()` for returning a response.

But... `server_corked` still contains a pointer to somewhere on the freed memory.

And that data might be used by another functions as it is freed...so our `gstring` struct will be corrupted
with random binary data.

This is the result of triggering the UAF:

```
gef➤  p *corked
$1 = {
  size = 0x54595c9c, 
  ptr = 0xa7e800ba, 
  s = 0x7e35043433160bd3 <error: Cannot access memory at address 0x7e35043433160bd3>
}
gef➤  p corked
$2 = (gstring *) 0x555ad3be1b58
gef➤  
```

This struct is in this way just when entering `tls_write()` for our command following the `STARTTLS`.

Obviously, once the `corked->s` is tried to be accessed results on a SIGSEGV interruption.

# Exploitation

As mentioned by Qualys, they use three steps to exploit the vulnerability:

1) As the memory is already free, we can make Exim to write heap pointers from structs like `header_line` into our buffer, so when `tls_write()` is called, it will be returned to the user. This way we have a memory leak to continue our exploitation.
2) Once we know the heap memory addresses, we can craft an arbitrary read primitive to start reading the heap until finding Exim configuration.
3) Finally the last step is to craft a write-what-where primitive. This way we would be able to inject custom configuration into the buffer found on step 2. We can inject `${run{<command>}}`, where `<command>` is any command the attacker would like to execute, like a reverse shell using netcat. This configuration will be interpreted by `string_expand()`, and will end up executing the command.

## Controlling the Use-After-Free condition

Nice, we were able to trigger the Use-After-Free.

Now we need take good control over the UAF so we can craft our
primitives successfully and reliably.

Unfortunately, after the buffers from `POOL_MAIN` are
freed, our block will be called into `free()` directly.

This means that memory wont just be accessed through `store_get_3()` or
`store_newblock_3()` but from any function that uses `malloc()`...like
`CRYPTO_zalloc()` and many more.

In this case, in somewhere at `tls_server_start()`, memory is requested
through `malloc()`.

Then copies some binary data into it, corrupting our `gstring` struct.

We need a way to prevent this, so we can reach `tls_write()` with a sane
`gstring` struct that points to a valid memory address, else a SIGSEGV
interrupt will be performed.

...to be continued....
